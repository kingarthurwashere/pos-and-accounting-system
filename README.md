# POS Setup

This guide will walk you through the setup process to get the application running smoothly on your local development machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- PHP (version 8.3 or greater)
- Composer
- A suitable SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- [Laravel requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/deployment#server-requirements)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the source repository from GitHub (or other version control systems) to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingarthurwashere/pos-and-accounting-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install PHP dependencies with Composer:

```bash
cd your-project-name
composer install
```

### 3. Generate Application Key

Generate a new unique key for your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 4. Database Migration

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 5. Database Seeding

Populate the database with initial data using the database seeder:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Running the Application

After completing the installation steps, you can run the application using Laravel's built-in server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, consider the following:

- Check the .env file settings, especially the database connections.
- Ensure all services (e.g., MySQL) are running.
- Review the application logs for any errors that may provide more insight.
- For further assistance, visit the Laravel documentation or seek help from the community forums.
